         But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and
         I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, 
         the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, 
         but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. 
         Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain,
         but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
    </p>

         On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled 
         and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
         foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail
         in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
         These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled
         and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best,
         every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.
